                    and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. His opinion of others
                    often only goes as far as his judgment of their strength, and he is rather apathetic towards anyone
                    he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his desire for power, Gojo is very arrogant. He
                    believes himself to be the strongest in the world, claiming, during his fight with Toji Fushiguro,
                    that "throughout heaven and earth, [he] alone is the honored one." It is evident during his task of
                    protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he genuinely grew to show compassion for.</p>

                    when he was just born. He was found wailing in the forest. The Yokai that lived there saw that Gin
                    was a harmless soul, and the Mountain God decided to save his life by casting a spell on Gin that
                    would maintain his body, and that he would age a quarter slower than a normal human would. However
                    the spell comes at a cost - if Gin comes into physical contact with humans, the spell would
                    obliterate, causing his body to disappear. The forest lord (Yamagami) gave a mask to baby Gin so he
                    would look more like a spirit, hoping to have him feel like he belonged.</p>

                    appears in the Metal Series anime. He debuts as the main antagonist of the first season, Beyblade:
                    Metal Fusion. As the series progresses, Ryuga largely remains independent of the main cast, although
                    he often assists them against a common enemy.
                    In Beyblade: Metal Masters, Ryuga returns with his newly evolved Meteo L-Drago LW105LF, which he
                    evolved on his own through intense training and mastery of L-Drago's power.

                    In Beyblade: Metal Fury, Ryuga inherits one of the Star Fragments, becoming a Legendary Blader and
                    evolving his Bey into L-Drago Destructor F:S.</p>

                    Neo Egoist League.
                    When first arriving at Blue Lock, Nagi was a member of Team V and was the best player in his
                    designated stratum. After the Blue Lock Eleven played against the Japan U-20 team, Nagi was ranked
                    as one of the top players in the project. However, he was locked off during the Neo Egoist League
                    when his ego and drive began to fade after beating Yoichi Isagi in a 1-on-1, but he renews it later
